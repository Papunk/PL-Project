# PAJeLang

### Synopsis

Our programming language sets out to provide tools for data analysis and visualization at a high level of abstraction. The language is primarily designed for analysis, rather than manipulaition, of data. The language is implemented in Java and thus has access to Java's robust support for creating and managing data structures while maintaining a simple syntax that draws inspiration from modern scripting languages. Users should not have to worry about the implementation details behind most constructs.

## Features

- **Global Functions:** Functions are declared at the top level and are available everywhere
- **Easy I/O:** It only takes one line to read a Graph, Tree, or Set from a supported file format
- **Static Typing:** Variable types are clearly defined
- **Helpful Errors:** The parser marks the line numbers with errors and gives helpful messages
- **Smart Error Detection:** All errors are identified on a single pass

## Instructions
1. Run Main.class
2. Run it with an argument to give it a custon input file or without arguments to run the included test file
3. Compile and run the resulting java class
