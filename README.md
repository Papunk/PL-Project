### Synopsis

Our programming language sets out to provide tools for data analysis and visualization at a high level of abstraction. The language is primarily designed for analysis, rather than manipulaition, of data. The language is implemented in Java and thus has access to Java's robust support for creating and managing data structures while maintaining a simple syntax that draws inspiration from modern scripting languages. Users should not have to worry about the implementation details behind most constructs.
